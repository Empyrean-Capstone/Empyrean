Here is how a new developer will initialize their database. 
This will assume that the user will have basic psql and python knowledge

1. Set up environment. In your .env file in the api directory, make sure the following line is present:
    export SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="postgresql://{username}:{password}@{host}/{database_name}"

    Where:
        username is the psql username desired,
        password is the password for that user
        host is the host running the database (localhost for development)
        and database name is the database holding the database

2. Install flask migrate. This tool allows us to automatically run database scripts without us having to do it ourselves

    $ pip install Flask-migrate

3. Initialize database: In the api directory, run the following commands:

    $ flask db init
    ^ Sets up all the migration files for now and later

    $ flask db migrate -m "Message here"
    ^ initializes the database with any new migrations

    $ flask db upgrade
    ^ takes any migrations and applies them to the database
