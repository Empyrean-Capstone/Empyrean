**Empyrean** is a web-based control system for astronomy cameras and spectrographs, designed to lower barriers to operation by abstracting away details other such tools saddle upon the astronomer. Using the Client-Server model, the aforementioned astronomical devices may connect to our application via interfaces, allowing various pairings of hardware to be controlled from the comfort of a simple reactive web UI.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Simple and intuitive user interface using recognizable styling
- Handles multiple users
- Back-end interface allows different types of cameras and spectrographs to connect to our system
